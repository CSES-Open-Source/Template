## Issue Labels

When opening issues or reviewing pull requests, please apply the most relevant label(s) to help maintainers triage and prioritize them. Here’s a basic guide:

| Label | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `bug` | A reproducible error, crash, or incorrect behavior in Taco. |
| `feature` | A new capability or enhancement that does not exist yet. |
| `enhancement` | Improvements to existing features, performance, or developer experience. |
| `docs` | Documentation updates, typos, or README/CONTRIBUTING changes. |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup or restructuring without changing behavior. |
| `ci` | Issues related to GitHub Actions, testing, or build pipelines. |
| `good first issue` | Small, well-scoped issues suitable for new contributors. |

**Tips:**
- Most issues should have **one primary label**.
- If an issue touches multiple areas (e.g., a feature that also needs docs), feel free to add more than one.
- PRs should ideally match the label of the issue they close.
